# Micro-Level-Dimensionality-Measurement-for-Product-Inspection-using-Machine-Vision
The incorporation of AI in the manufacturing industry has improved the efficiency and safety in its operations, thereby reducing labor hardships. In order to facilitate automatic visual inspection on the objects that are manufactured daily, Machine Vision is used after the process of manufacturing. With the advancement in AI, it is possible to embed new processing units in the camera that can perform tasks which required dedicated servers earlier, with the aid of Deep Learning. In this work, our aim is to measure the geometric structure of screws and to identify the defects present in them. Finally, our results infers that irrespective of the micro level objects it outperforms the state of the art method with our novel photogrammetry approach which can be implemented in any industrial setup for the quality inspections of valves, engine spares etc. at the micro level.
